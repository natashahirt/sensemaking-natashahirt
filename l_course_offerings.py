#  12. Course Offerings Over Time
# 
#  After extracting the course data from 
#  both the 1996 and present catalogs, 
#  analyze the number of courses offered 
#  in various departments. Are there any 
#  departments that have significantly 
#  expanded or reduced their course offerings? 
#  If so, identify them and discuss possible 
#  reasons for these changes.
