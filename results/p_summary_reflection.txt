#  12. Course Offerings Over Time
# 
#  After extracting the course data from 
#  both the 1996 and present catalogs, 
#  analyze the number of courses offered 
#  in various departments. Are there any 
#  departments that have significantly 
#  expanded or reduced their course offerings? 
#  If so, identify them and discuss possible 
#  reasons for these changes.
# -----------------------------------------------

There are two majors that have significantly increased their course offering: course 6 (CS) and
course 15 (business/Sloan). Overall though, I think that the distribution of classes remains the 
same or similar. Course 6 and 15 were already the majors with the most courses in 1996, but
MIT offering more classes across the board makes the difference seem much more drastic.

MIT has always been a tech school, and computation has been a big part of its work for the last
decades, as this is where the cutting edge is. There is also demand for high-class managers and
particularly people who are smart about business analytics, which is what Sloan is known for. 

Other majors e..g HST, TPP, CSE, WGS which didn't exist in 1996 now exist, suggesting that there
is both more of an emphasis on interdisciplinary studies (e.g. CSE is computational science AND
engineering) as well as there being a greater emphasis on HASS and social topics around equality.

I would say we are trending

#  13. Title Evolution:
# 
#  Conduct a word frequency analysis 
#  on course titles from 1996 and 2024 
#  to explore shifts in academic 
#  terminology and focus areas.
# -----------------------------------------------

I plotted the intersection between the top 100 lines of the 1996 catalog and 2024 catalog. 
The plots are shown as increase in percentages (i.e. "subject" was used 19% more in the 2024
catalog vs the 1996 catalog) because absolute numbers would have been an unfair comparison
given the larger sample set. 

If we exclude "special subject", the combination of which is new to 2024, the next most
increased word used is "engineering", followed by "science" and "design". There appears to be
a greater focus on interdisciplinary fields ("Data" (0.039)... "computational" (0.033)... 
"machine" (0.024)... "analytics" (0.013)... and "modeling" (0.013)) etc. There is also an 
increase in terms regarding societal and global concerns (global" (0.040), "sustainable" (0.013),
"climate" (0.018), "energy" (0.034), and "sustainability" (0.008)). Industrial and mechanical
fields seem to be less important than newer fields like computation.

# -----------------------------------------------
#  14. New and Discontinued Subjects:
# 
#  Identify subjects that were offered in 
#  1996 but no longer exist in 2024, as 
#  well as new subjects introduced in 2024. 
#  Explore possible reasons for these changes.
# ----------------------------------------------

To summarize the outcomes of this I plotted the distribution of majors from old (subject 
numbers that only exist in 1996) and new (subject numbers that only exist in 2024). This 
shows both turnover as well as absolute increase in numbers. Pure 21 courses have all but
disappeared now that there are additional subcategories 21A, 21H, 21L etc. There has been
incredibly high turnover in course 6 (more than in course 15). Course 5 shows a good deal
of overlap. The Military Science major is completely gone now, though Naval Science has new
subjects and still exists. This shift points to innovation in the fields as well as to changes
in catalog naming convention (e.g. the changes to all the course 6 numerations a few years
ago).

# -----------------------------------------------
#  15. Curriculum Breadth:
# 
#  Compare the breadth of topics in the 
#  1996 and 2024 catalogs to assess whether 
#  the curriculum has become more 
#  interdisciplinary or specialized.
# -----------------------------------------------

I analyzed the catalog to find the incidence of "interdisciplinary" words such as 'cross-
disciplinary', 'multidisciplinary', 'integrative', 'applied to', and 'interdisciplinary'. 
The number of classes that had one or more of these words were:
- 1996:  61 out of 2676  (2.2%)
- 2024:  156 out of 5881 (2.6%)
This scales pretty much with the number of classes that were available. At least the explicit 
mention of interdisciplinary work has not changed substantially.

# -----------------------------------------------
#  16. Summary and Reflection:
# 
#  Summarize your findings from the 
#  previous tasks, reflecting on the most 
#  significant changes in the MIT course 
#  catalog over time. Relate these changes to 
#  broader trends in education and industry.
# -----------------------------------------------

Overall we will see subjects that are trending toward more computation and less physical
manufacturing work. The economy is shifting to a knowledge industry, at least in elite 
universities, and the skillset required is shifting in a similar manner.
