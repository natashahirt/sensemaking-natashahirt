Thomson, V. McGee",,

24.03,"Relativism, Reason, and Reality"," An examination of philosophical issues on the theme of relativism. Are moral standards relative to cultures and/or moral frameworks? Are there incompatible or non-comparable ways of thinking about the world that are somehow equally good? Can any sense be made of the idea that truth is relative? Is rationality the notion of a good reason to believe something relative to cultural norms? Is the idea of a completely objective description of the world incoherent? Discussion of these questions through the writings of contemporary philosophers such as Thomas Kuhn, Nelson Goodman, Bernard Williams, and Hilary Putnam.

Do scientific theories describe an underlying reality, or do they merely provide an economical systemization of experimental results? E Hall 24.07 Classics in the History of Philosophy Introduction to philosophy through its history. Readings in the works of such philosophers as Plato, Aristotle, Aquinas, Descartes, Hume, and Kant.

Should the state seek to advance a particular view of the good life? Staff Descriptions of Subjects 531 School of Humanities and Social Science 24.111 Philosophy of Quantum Mechanics Quantum mechanics is said to describe a world in which physical objects often lack ""definite"" properties, indeterminism creeps in at the point of ""observation,"" ordinary logic does not apply, and distant events are perfectly yet inexplicably correlated.

Many philosophers working within the mainstream tradition of Anglo-American analytic philosophy would like to think so; yet their attempts at precisely elucidating such standards have met with rather spectacular failure when tested against the history of science. One response to this failure is to insist that all scientific knowledge is ""socially constructed."" But is this really the only response available?

An eight-week academic and survival skills-honing program, Project Interphase is designed to enhance the preparedness of underrepresented minority students entering MIT in the fall semester. The program has a dual focus: academic readiness and general educational development. The program involves calculus, chemistry, physical education, physics, writing, and supporting academic activities, including small-group learning. The students can earn transcript credit for subjects taken in the program, sometimes resulting in advanced placement in corresponding subjects taken in the fall. Activities include day trips to area cultural, recreational, and business sites. Students participate in a range of personal educational development seminars and activities designed to insure their smooth transition to college life. The summer experience gives them increased opportunity to prepare for the rigors of an MIT full-subject load. Program XL SEM.XL1 Program XL: You Can Be a Success at MIT (Revised Units) SEM.XL2 Program XL: You Can Be a Success at MIT An academic enrichment program for first-year students, XL utilizes the innovative and effective small-group learning concept to enhance students' academic performance in calculus and science. Students meet in study groups of five to six participants with facilitators trained in effective classroom techniques and concept focus. The study groups help students to reinforce concepts learned in the regular curriculum, and help them to gain mastery of concepts and problems that are often more challenging than those dealt with during lecture. The small study group format emphasizes the full participation of each student with the facilitator acting as a guide. The regularity of weekly meetings enhances the students' understanding of MIT's academic expectations. After the initial meetings, students are encouraged to take more responsibility and to lead the group in problem-solving sessions, which helps to maximize their own learning. Each study group meets for a minimum of three hours each week. The meeting time is set by the XL facilitator based on students' schedules.
