The third round, students conduct themselves as the class project on an imaging system of their choice. The undergraduate and graduate versions share lectures but have different recitations. Throughout the term, we also conduct optional ""clinics"" to even out background knowledge of linear algebra, optimization, and computational imaging-related programming best practices for students of diverse disciplinary backgrounds.Textbooks Fall 2024",Graduate,Fall,,18.C06  1.00  1.000  2.086  3.019  6.100A  ,3-0-9,G.
